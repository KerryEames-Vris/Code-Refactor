# Code-Refactor

## Description
I was given an existing code base of HTML and CSS to refactor to the standards of general accesibility to both the end user and future developers looking to alter the code. The goal was to make sure the code was easier to add to or change as it was missing many semantic HMTL elements. Adding these elements to the lines of code will make it easier in the future to make alterations. I was also looking to add features such as alt attributes to images within the page for the convenience of people who use things like screen readers.

# Installation
1. Select the clone option from the repository page and copy the SSH link.
2. Navigate your terminal of choice to the directory you'd like the repository to be stored in.
3. Enter "git clone " and paste the copied SSH link into the terminal and run the command.
4. Open the HTML and CSS files using your preffered code editing software

# Usage
This code shows the requisite webpage as shown. The project was not to make any changes, just to refactor.
